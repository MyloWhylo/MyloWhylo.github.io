		<h2>Camcorders</h2>
		<p>
			Yep. VHS camcorders. Why would anyone be interested in those in
			<!-- We do a little bit of trolling -->
			<script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear())</script>? Well, as an avid collector of inconvenient
			technology, I'm naturally drawn towards the hassle that is shooting on tape. So when one of my pro cameras
			arrived without a battery, I knew not having one was simply off the table. Unfortunately, they kinda were
			about $100-$300 online, which is frankly out of my budget. So what's a technology-inclined fella to do?
			Simple: I'd build my own.
		</p>

		<h3>Part 0: Is this even feasible?</h3>
		<p>
			Before I began, I needed to know if it even made sense to do this. If I made my own, would it be cheaper?
			Luckily, one of my friends had a busted-up electric longboard with a good battery. I could probably use that,
			get a converter module and toggle switch off eBay, and bam, good to go. I priced it out, and it came to ~$50.
			Perfect.
		</p>

		<h3>Part 1: Design</h3>
		<p>
			Now I'll preface this by saying that I"m not very good at making things look pretty. I'm a big fan of boxes with
			rounded edges because that's all I know how to make. I started off by modeling the battery and converter module,
			so I'd have a rough guideline to work with. Then, I started making just a huge box to put everything in. After some 
			iteration, here's what I came up with:
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">
			<img src="images/camcorder/3dmodel.png" alt="An ugly 3D model" style="width:100%;">
		</p>
		<p>
			It's genuinely just a box. But then I had what I'm going to call An Idea&trade;. This is like the perfect job for a 
			laser cutter, and I get free use of one through college. So I quickly whipped up a design:
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">
			<img src="images/camcorder/avlibox.png" alt="A nicer 2D model" style="width:100%;">
		</p>
		<p>
			Significantly better. All I had to do was order the parts and fabricate it.
		</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Getting Real</h3>
		<p>
			I went to the makerspace, and got cutting. Unfortunately, I didn't take many pictures during the assembly proecss,
			but I do have this pic from after:
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">
			<img src="images/camcorder/cambox.jpg" alt="The camera with the box on it" style="width:100%;">
		</p>
		<p>
			I haven't gotten around to gluing it together (schoolwork keeps me busy!), but once I will I'll post an update.
			All told I'm in for ~$50, so I'm under half the cost of a proper battery. That's a success in my book!
