		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p>
			You've found my projects page! Here's a small collection of some of the projects I've worked on
			in my free time. You might find something interesting!
		</p>
		<h3><a href="/projects/thermprint.html">Thermal Printer</a></h3>
		<p>
			I bought a reciept printer. What can a college student do with a reciept printer? Why, print out 
			all sorts of shenanigans. Check out my Discord printer, as well as my optical paper tape projects here.
		</p>
		<h3><a href="/projects/camcorders.html">Camcorders</a></h3>
			<p>
				My love of analog video is pretty much never ending. I've got a few camcorders, and needed to make a
				battery for one of them. Keep up with the ongoing project here.
			</p>
		<h3><a href="/projects/betacam.html">Linear Editing</a></h3>
			<p>
				Continuing from above, if I've got a way to capture footage, I need a way to edit it. Follow me as I
				collect all the components to make a retro linear editing setup! Rackmount tape players, surplus stores,
				expensive shipping prices, what's not to love?
